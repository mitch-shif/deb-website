Debra Cinamon Whalenfiber artist	I am a recent Bachelor of Fine Arts graduate from The New Hampshire Institute of Art.  I was an interdisciplinary major.  This exposed me to many different mediums as a student.  I was then able to incorporate painting, sculpture and the many disciplines I have studied into my fiber work. I am interested in working in two and three dimensional  form.  Group Exhibitions2006		Juried Student Show, The New Hampshire Institute of Art, Manchester, NH2006		Juried Gallery Show, The New Hampshire Institue of Art, Manchester,NH2005		Juried Student Show, Mass Art, Boston,MA2005		Bikram Yoga Studio,Bridge Street, Manchester, NH2005		Juried Student Show,The New Hampshire Institute of Art , Manchester, NH 2004		Juried Student Show, The New Hampshire Institute of Art, Manchester, NH2003		Studio 7, The New Hampshire Institute of Art, Manchester, NH2002		Studio 7, The New Hampshire Institute of Art, Manchester, NH2000		Images 2000, Marlboro, MA1997		New England Quilt Alliance.Westford, MAArtist in Residence2005		Newfields Elementary School, Newfields, NH, half day shibori workshop with 		5th grade 2006		Great Bay e-Learning Charter School, Exeter, NH.
