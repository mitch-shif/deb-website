> Dear deb,
>
> With the new Congress in Washington, DC, we have a tremendous 
> opportunity to make progress in our campaign to end the practice of 
> mountaintop removal coal mining.
>
> But to realize that opportunity, we need you to take action today.
>
> In the coming weeks, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey is 
> preparing to introduce the Clean Water Protection Act in the new 110th 
> Congress. This act eliminates a loophole that has allowed coal 
> companies to dump millions of tons of mine waste into nearby streams 
> when they practice mountaintop removal coal mining.
>
> Will you take a moment today to write your Representatives and ask 
> them to join Rep. Pallone by becoming a co-sponsor of the Clean Water 
> Protection Act?

> Before the last congress adjourned, we secured the support of 77 
> cosponsors for the Clean Water Protection Act.
>
> But in the new Congress, the bill must be introduced again -- and our 
> goal is to start with 77 original cosponsors, sending a loud message 
> that the American people and their representatives are ready to close 
> the loopholes that allow mountaintop removal coal mining.
>
> Please, take a moment today to contact your representatives. It takes 
> only a moment using our online tools, but Congress needs to hear from 
> you.
