			<p>I am also a fiber artist.&nbsp; The tactile qualities of wool roving, the  shimmering smoothness of haboti silk, or the over grown forsythia bush in my  back yard, all excite me to create. I am interested in the intrinsic beauty of  nature.&nbsp; The systems in our complex  environment are so delicately woven together, one depending on the health of  the other. My concern is man&rsquo;s domination over the earth and its  resources.&nbsp; Every natural system is  compromised by some level of pollution. All of us make choices each day that  impact the earth, the world we all share. I weave and sew these themes into my work;  this is where my inspiration comes from.&nbsp; Please click the link below to see my fabric art.</p>
