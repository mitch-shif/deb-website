          <td valign="top" class="bodyText"><p>I have been concerned about the devastating practice of mountain top 
removal coal mining for quite some time. The  feeling of  wishing I 
could do something to help stop it gnawed at me.  Eric Reece, author of 
Lost Mountain, wrote a compelling article about MTR for Orion magazine. 
  What was so powerful about the article is that Eric connected the 
reader to the people of Appalachia, and their stories of floods, 
poisoned water, personal illness, and death.  Then I realized what I 
needed to do; we need to connect our communities to educate people on 
this issue, in order to put an end to mountain top removal, and so the 
healing blankets for the earth project was born.
	What is a healing blanket?  It is created with wool fleece, and 
gathered organic materials,  seeds from flowers, weeds, acorns, 
grasses, shells,etc. and felted into burlap. The idea is to connect 
students to their environment, and learn about the Appalachian 
Mountains and mountain top removal coal mining at the same time.  
Talking about environmental issues becomes more meaningful to people 
when they are engaged in a process that brings them into the woods, and 
fields, or offers them an opportunity to investigate natural materials 
close up. The fleece comes in many colors and it becomes the pallet for 
the blanket.  The students design the blanket combining their ideas.  
The blankets are about the size of a twin bed. When they are finished, 
they are mailed to people whose stories have touched us.  It is then 
installed by the recipient into the landscape to help regenerate and 
heal the ecosystem that has been damaged by MTR.  This eco-art 
installation  acts as a bridge between our communities, and offers 
support to the people in coal country.
