			<p>My first exposure to clay was as a young child in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The   pond I swam in had clay deposits in the shallow wet edges. I remember scooping   it up and squishing it in between my fingers, and creating my first pinch pot.   To this day I am still excited by the tactile qualities of clay. The organic forms   that spring from the clay intrigue me.</p>
